# Illinois General Assembly Witness Slip Scraper – Project Summary

## Project Goal  
Scrape accurate witness slip data (proponents, opponents, no position) for all Illinois House Bills across multiple General Assembly (GA) sessions and optionally enrich that data using LegiScan bill metadata.

---

## Key Components Required

### 1. ILGA Website Access
- Witness slip URL structure:  
  `https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/witnessslip.asp?...`
- Bill status URL structure used for `DocNum`, `GA`, etc.

### 2. Correct Session Identifiers
Each GA session uses:
- `GA` (General Assembly number)
- `GAID` (internal session ID)
- `SessionID`

### 3. HTML Structure
Witness slip counts are found inside:
```html
<td class="tabcontrol">Proponents: X</td>
```

### 4. JSON Metadata (from LegiScan)
LegiScan exports per-bill metadata:
- `bill_number`, `title`, `sponsors`, `status`, etc.
- Used to determine bill counts per GA and enrich outputs

### 5. Output Structure
CSV with:
```
bill_number, title, doc_num, proponents, opponents, no_position, total_slips, witness_slip_url
```

## Iterative Process Summary

### 1. Base Scraper for 103rd GA (HB1–4000)
- Built Python script using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`
- Initially parsed full witness slip tables (inaccurate)

### 2. Switched to Summary Counts
- Validated HTML shows totals inside `.tabcontrol` cells
- New parsing logic:
```python
td_elements = soup.find_all("td", class_="tabcontrol")
proponents = extract(td_elements[0].text)
```

### 3. Tested with Small Sample
- Limited scrape to HB1–25 to verify data

### 4. Fixed “0 Remaining Bills” Bug
- Caused by using an incomplete CSV for doc_num comparisons
- Fix:
```python
df['doc_num'] = pd.to_numeric(df['doc_num'], errors='coerce')
```

### 5. Scraped Remaining Bills
- Used range skipping existing bills
- Example:
```python
range(4001, 5924)
```
- Added 0.1s delay and progress printout

### 6. Incorporated LegiScan JSON Metadata
Used to:
- Count number of actual House Bills
- Validate or enrich scraped witness slip data

Steps:
```python
len([f for f in os.listdir(json_dir) if f.startswith('HB')])
```
- Merging based on `bill_number` or extracted `doc_num`

### 7. Adapted for 102nd GA (HB1–7030)
- Updated identifiers:
```python
GA = "102", GAID = "16", SessionID = "110"
```
- Created full and test scrapers (15-bill sample)

---

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

---

## Directory Requirements

- Folder of LegiScan JSONs (e.g., `102_bill/`)
- Output CSVs: `103rd_HB_SLIPS.csv`, `102nd_HB_SLIPS.csv`, etc.

---

## Optional Features (For Future Development)

- Auto-resume or fail-safe logic
- Merge with JSON metadata inline
- Write error logs
- Save to SQLite, JSONL, or upload to GitHub
