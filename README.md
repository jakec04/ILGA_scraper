# Illinois General Assembly Witness Slip Scraper – Project Summary

## Project Goal  
Scrape accurate witness slip data (proponents, opponents, no position) for all Illinois House Bills across multiple General Assembly (GA) sessions and optionally enrich that data using LegiScan bill metadata.

---

## Key Components Required

### 1. ILGA Website Access
- Witness slip URL structure:  
  `https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/witnessslip.asp?...`
- Bill status URL structure used for `DocNum`, `GA`, etc.

### 2. Correct Session Identifiers
Each GA session uses:
- `GA` (General Assembly number)
- `GAID` (internal session ID)
- `SessionID`

### 3. HTML Structure
Witness slip counts are found inside:
```html
<td class="tabcontrol">Proponents: X</td>
```

### 4. JSON Metadata (from LegiScan)
LegiScan exports per-bill metadata:
- `bill_number`, `title`, `sponsors`, `status`, etc.
- Used to determine bill counts per GA and enrich outputs

### 5. Output Structure
CSV with:
```
bill_number, title, doc_num, proponents, opponents, no_position, total_slips, witness_slip_url
```

## The process of making the scraper

### 1. Base Scraper for 103rd GA (HB1–4000)
- Built Python script using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`
- Initially parsed full witness slip tables (inaccurate)

### 2. Switched to Summary Counts
- Validated ILGA back-end HTML shows totals inside `.tabcontrol` cells
- New parsing logic:
```python
td_elements = soup.find_all("td", class_="tabcontrol")
proponents = extract(td_elements[0].text)
```

### 3. Tested with Small Sample
- Limited scrape to HB1–25 to verify scraper function

### 4. Fixed “0 Remaining Bills” Bug
- Caused by using an incomplete CSV for doc_num comparisons
- Fix:
```python
df['doc_num'] = pd.to_numeric(df['doc_num'], errors='coerce')
```

### 5. Scraped Remaining Bills
- Used range skipping existing bills
- Example:
```python
range(4001, 5924)
```
- Added 0.1s delay and progress printout

### 6. Incorporated LegiScan JSON Metadata
Used to:
- Count number of actual House Bills
- Validate or enrich scraped witness slip data

Steps:
```python
len([f for f in os.listdir(json_dir) if f.startswith('HB')])
```
- Merging based on `bill_number` or extracted `doc_num`

### 7. Adapted for 102nd GA (HB1–7030)
- Updated identifiers:
```python
GA = "102", GAID = "16", SessionID = "110"
```
- Created full and test scrapers (smaller quantity to ensure scraper was working correctly) 

---

## Dependencies

```python
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

---

## Directory Requirements

- Folder of LegiScan JSONs (e.g., `102_bill/`)
- Output CSVs: `103rd_HB_SLIPS.csv`, `102nd_HB_SLIPS.csv`, etc

## Data Analysis Guide

Once you have your `*.csv` output file, you can run statistical summaries to understand witness slip patterns across bills.

### Example: Summarize `total_slips` Column

Create a script named `summarize_slip_statistics.py` with the following:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your CSV
df = pd.read_csv("103rd_HB_SLIPS.csv")  # or your file path

# Descriptive stats
print("Descriptive Statistics for total_slips:")
print(df["total_slips"].describe())

# Additional insights
print("\nBills with 0 slips:", (df["total_slips"] == 0).sum())
print("Bills with > 100 slips:", (df["total_slips"] > 100).sum())
print("Bills with > 500 slips:", (df["total_slips"] > 500).sum())
print("Bills with > 1000 slips:", (df["total_slips"] > 1000).sum())

# Top 10 bills by slip volume
print("\nTop 10 bills by total_slips:")
print(df.sort_values("total_slips", ascending=False)[["bill_number", "total_slips"]].head(10))
```

---

This analysis helps reveal how many bills received large volumes of public input, and can identify the most contentious or widely supported legislation in each session.
